A super, simple guide to me.

* I sit in the greater metro Denver area when not in the Denver office. Denver
  is
  [America/Denver Mountain Time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/usa/denver).
* I plan to be in the Denver office on Tuesdays and Thursdays even though the
  bulk of my team is not in the Denver office.
* Regardless if I am wearing headphones or have earbuds in, you may approach
  me without hesitation if there is something I can do for you. I am eager and
  always willing to help when / if I can.
* As engineers many times are, I appear mostly introverted in nature, however
  given the chance, I will talk your ear off.
* Crowds quiet me, so I'll be more available and engaged in a more
  intimate, one-on-one conversation.
* Part of my quiet nature comes from being unofficially hard-of-hearing.
  Many times I am lost in larger conversations because I just can not hear
  what is being said or follow what is going on.
* I do have moderate to severe hearing loss in the upper ranges of
  human speech but am not officially labeled hard-of-hearing. Read more
